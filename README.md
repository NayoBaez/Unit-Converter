# UNIT CONVERTER

This Unit Converter built with Raw Javascript, manipulates the DOM with every click on the button. The user is able to enter a new input and see the calculations for each unit individually. I created this app by participating on a solo challenge where only a figma template was provided. What I learned during the process is how to make my code DRY, since I initially had hard coded the formulas twice.
